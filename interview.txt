💡 Feedback on Your Intro:

Keep it simple — avoid too much technical detail (like SaaS/PaaS) in the first intro. Save that for when they specifically ask.

Flow — try to break it into 3 parts: Who you are → What you’ve done → Why you’re here.

Confidence tone — end with excitement about learning + contributing.
